BiographyDr. Mariana Kersh is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering and Health Innovation Professor in the Carle Illinois College of Medicine at The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  She is Director of the Tissue Biomechanics Laboratory.  Previously, she was a post-doctoral research fellow in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Melbourne.  Her research focuses on the use of experimental methods to evaluate macro-level mechanical and structural properties of bone, cartilage, and connective tissues, such as ligaments, in order to include them into finite element simulations of these tissues under physiological loads.  She first received a Bachelor of Arts in English at The University of Texas-Austin, then went on to receive a Bachelors and Masters in Mechanical Engineering, and PhD in Materials Science Engineering at The University of Wisconsin – Madison as a National Science Foundation Pre-Doctoral Fellow.

Research Interests
Primary interest: Mechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues, joint movement, imaging, structure-function relationships.

Bone and joint diseases such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis significantly impact the quality of life of those afflicted, and impose a personal and societal financial burden.  Relating the structural and mechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues to their function can help increase our understanding and therefore the treatment of bone and joint diseases.  We explore the structure and organization of biological materials using clinical-level medical images.  By doing so, we can link architecture to functional outcomes – such as survivability and strength derived from novel experimental techniques.  We also use the  finite-element method to answer those questions that are difficult to do so experimentally.
