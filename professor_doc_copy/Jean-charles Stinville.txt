BiographyDr. Jean-Charles Stinville studied in France, where he was a first generation college student. He holds a Master of Engineering in Aeronautics, Materials Science, Computer Science and Mechanics, a Master of Science in Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering, and a Ph.D. in Solid Mechanics, Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering. His Ph.D. work on the mechanical properties of plasma treated stainless steels for nuclear application has been awarded with the highest academic distinction in the French academic system. In 2012, he joined the research group of T.M. Pollock at the University of California Santa Barbara, where he became a Specialist in 2015. His research interests include the mechanical and environmental performance of metallic materials for high temperature, energy, and environmental applications.   As a Specialist in the Materials Department at the University of California Santa Barbara, he has led efforts around experimental development of in-situ (SEM) mechanical characterization techniques. He is a recipient of the Hetényi Award, which is given annually for the best research paper published in Experimental Mechanics. He has also been recognized for his contribution to the understanding of the fatigue properties of nickel-based superalloys and awarded by the Best Paper Award at EuroSuperalloy2018.  He holds appointments in the Materials Science and Engineering Department and the Materials Research Laboratory  at the UIUC.  His research focuses, amongst others, on the characterization of deformation processes for mechanical properties prediction and design of novel metallic materials.  He plays an important role in the MatSE Department’s future directions in metals and materials characterization for extreme environments.
