Professional Highlights
Development of an integrated hands-on four-year design curriculum in ME, and advising the Aerospace Engineering department in the development of a similar sequence.  
Advising new educational initiatives through my role as the inaugural Entrepreneurial Mindset Fellow (EMF) in the college.  These initiatives include assisting the development of a new capstone course in Materials Science and Engineering.   
Development of exciting laboratory exercises to improve the curriculum in our BSME program, such as a fountain design project to replace a stale exercise for measuring head losses in pipe flows, and a new inquiry-based pedagogy in an undergraduate Heat Transfer laboratory 
Building and sustaining and oral presentation skills program that serves capstone courses, REUs, research centers, and even department-wide faculty development (Engineers SPEAK) 
Current work on a University-wide Service Learning Ecosystem, which is already impacting local K--12 schools and will eventually have a state-wide reach 
Designing, implementing, and constantly improving a TA Training Course that serves the Grainger College of Engineering, which is presently required coursework for the four largest departments in the college (CS, ECE, MechSE, CEE)
