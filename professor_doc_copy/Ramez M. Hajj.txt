BiographyRamez Hajj is an Assistant Professor in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.  Prior to joining UIUC, he completed his Ph.D. and Master's in Civil Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.  He obtained his Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering with a minor in Engineering Science and Mechanics from Virginia Tech.  Dr. Hajj's research spans everything related to asphalt materials and flexible pavements, from as small as investigating asphalt binder behavior at the molecular, nano-, and micro-scale, to developing novel materials for roadway pavement and railroad trackbed applications, to solving network-level transportation infrastructure problems. Primarily, his research focuses on asphalt binders, mixtures, and pavements, but more broadly, these research areas are situated in wider research areas of viscoelasticity, composites, machine learning and computational modeling. So far, his work includes fundamental scientific discoveries into the origins of cracking in asphalt binder microstructure, as well as practical contributions to the asphalt industry, state Departments of Transportation, and local transportation agencies. To date, he has published in a wide range of peer-reviewed journals in these areas, and presented his work at many international conferences. Currently, Dr. Hajj's research is funded by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), the Smart Transportation Infrastructure Initiative (STII), the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant, and numerous industry partners.

Research StatementMy research occurs at the intersection of Transportation, Materials, and Mechanics.  My lab focuses on developing a better understanding of the mechanical fundamentals that drive behavior of infrastructure materials.  In the long term, I hope that the work we do will lead to the development of a new generation of materials for pavements and other applications that can contribute to a more durable, more sustainable, and longer lasting infrastructure.
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesI am currently looking for motivated undergraduate students who want to learn more about the world of asphalt materials and pavements.  Interested students should contact me with a copy of their resume.
Graduate Research OpportunitiesI am currently looking for Graduate Research Assistants and the Masters and PhD level for Fall 2020 and beyond.  Interested students should contact me with a CV.
Post-Doctoral Research OpportunitiesI am not currently looking to hire Post-Doctoral scholars.  However, externally funded post docs are welcome to apply to join my research group.
