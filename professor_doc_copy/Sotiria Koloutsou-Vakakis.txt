Research Interests
air quality, aerosol particles, trace gases in the atmosphere, nitrogen cycle, atmosphere-land exchange, air pollution monitoring and control, environmental policy, global environmental politics

Research StatementMy main research interest is to study land-atmosphere interactions with emphasis on impacts to air quality and climate change. My goal has been to develop the infrastructure and experience base to enable both measurements of trace gases and modelling using chemical transport models. NSF funded a project on the quantification of ammonia fluxes from agriculture using micrometeorological methods. A project funded by USDA allowed investigation of effects of field management practices on the emissions of nitrous oxide, which is a potent greenhouse gas. As a result of persistent work, a full scale air quality modeling platform (not available before at UIUC) has been built on the engineering college cluster, including state of the art weather, emissions and regional 3-D chemical transport model, while a biogeochemical model was adapted for the Linux platform to enable its integration with the emissions model.
