BiographyAl-Qadi, the Grainger Distinguished Chair in Engineering, is the Director of the Illinois Center for Transportation (ICT) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Al-Qadi is also leading the initiative to build the Illinois Autonomous and Connected Track (I-ACT), a proposed high-speed, multimodal test track in Rantoul, Illinois. He served as an instructor and research engineer at Penn State University from 1988 to 1990 and was a member of the faculty of the Charles E. Via Jr. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech from 1990 to 2004. By 1998, he had been promoted to full professor and shortly after named the Charles E. Via Jr. Professor. Al-Qadi holds a B.S. (1984) from Yarmouk University in Jordan and M.Eng. (1986) and Ph.D. (1990) degrees from Penn State University, all in civil engineering.
At Virginia Tech, Al-Qadi established the roadway infrastructure group and designed the various heavily instrumented pavement sections of the Smart Road, a state-of-the-art, full-scale, test bed research facility that become one of the leading facilities in North America in providing diverse test environments for transportation research. At UIUC, Al-Qadi established and elevated ICT to an internationally renowned transportation center. He also built out a premiere and innovative program for advanced mobility as part of the state-of-the-art I-ACT, which is currently being designed and is slated to become one of the most advanced test tracks in the world for such technologies. This program includes a focus on electric and autonomous cars and freight as well as energy harvesting.
Al-Qadi’s teaching, research, and consulting interests and expertise focus primarily on highway and airfield pavement mechanics, advanced modeling, tire-pavement interaction, pavement fracture modeling and testing, interface and interlayer systems (including geosynthetics), pavement materials, sustainability, resiliency, and life-cycle assessment, asphalt mixes and performance, modified asphalt binder rheology, pavement recycling optimization, ground-penetrating radar optimization and signal analysis, infrastructure asset management systems and pavement condition assessment, preservation technologies, transportation infrastructure instrumentation and full-scale accelerated testing; autonomous and conceded vehicles and trucks, energy harvesting, truck platoons, and forensic engineering and arbitration.
A registered professional engineer, Al-Qadi is an elected Distinguished Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Chapter Honor Member of Chi Epsilon, the Civil Engineering Honor Society, honorary member of the Societa Italiana Infrastrutture Viarie, emeritus member of TRB Committee on Pavement Maintenance, and served as an honorary professor at Southeast University in Nanjing, Chang ’An University in Xian, and Tongi University in Shanghai, China; Aston University, UK; and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, as well as an honorary chair professor at Harbin Institute of Technology, China and the ARAMCO honorary chair at KFU, Saudi Arabia. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Pavement Engineering, Associate Editor of the Research in Nondestructive Evaluation Journal, past Regional Editor of the Construction and Building Materials Journal, and Guest Editor of other journals. He also serves on the editorial boards of several other journals.
Al-Qadi is the only pavement engineer to ever receive the National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award (1994) and the Quadrennial International Geosynthetic Society Award (2002).
