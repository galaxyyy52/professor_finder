BiographyDr. Lei Zhao is an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and assistant professor affiliated with the National Center of Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). His research concerns the physical and engineering processes in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer where most human activities and environmental systems are concentrated, with a particular focus on built surfaces and urban environments. He combines theory, numerical modeling, remote sensing and in situ observations, and cutting-edge AI/ML methods to study environmental fluid mechanics and land-atmosphere interaction that relate to urban environments, climatology and hydrology, climate change, climate impacts and adaptation. He is the recipient of a U.S. NSF CAREER Award. He received his Ph.D. in atmospheric physics from the School of the Environment at Yale University and the B.S. degree in Physics and Atmospheric Physics from Nanjing University in China. Before joining at UIUC, Lei was a postdoctoral research fellow at Princeton University.
