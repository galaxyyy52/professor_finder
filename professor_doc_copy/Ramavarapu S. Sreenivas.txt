Education
Ph.D., Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, 1990

B.Tech		Electrical Engr.		Indian Inst. of Tech.		1985

BiographyI received a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, (IIT) Madras, India in 1985. I was at the IIT, Madras from 1980-1985. I have an M.S. and a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. I was at Carnegie Mellon between 1985 and 1990. I then moved to Harvard University, where I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Decision and Control at what was then the Division of Applied Sciences. After a two-year stint at Harvard, I came to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I am a Professor with the Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering Department. I hold research appointments at the Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL) and the Information Trust Institute (ITI). I am also an affiliate of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, and an Arthur Davis Faculty Scholar at the University of Illinois.

Teaching StatementAt the undergraduate level I have taught courses in the controls curriculum (SE320: Introductory Control Systems; SE420: Digital Control of Dynamic Systems; SE423: Introduction to Mechatronics; SE424: State Space Design Methods in Control) in the Systems Engineering & Design program. I have advised several projects in the industry-sponsored Senior Engineering Project (SE494: Senior Engineering Project I; SE495: Senior Engineering Project II) in the Systems Engineering & Design curriculum. At the graduate-level I have taught advanced topic courses in the Controls- and the Industrial Engineering curriculum in the College (AE555: Multivariable Control Design; SE525: Discrete Event Systems; IE511: Integer Programming; IE531: Algorithms for Data Analytics). I have been involved in the Master of Science in Financial Engineering (MSFE) Program since May 2006, when it was first conceived. This Cross-College Program that now involves several faculty from the Colleges of Engineering and Business. I teach IE523: Financial Computing in this program. This program is currently ranked 4th in the FE-Programs. I have co-taught HT503: Hardware Engineering for Health Technology, and HT 504: Software Engineering for Health Technology, in the Health Technology (HT) program at the UIUC, as well. I have appeared in the "List of Instructors Ranked Excellent" twenty-four times for a variety of courses, and I was the recipient of the 2023 UIUC Campus Award for Excellence in Graduate and Professional Teaching.
Research StatementMy current research is on the Analysis, Control and Performance Evaluation of a broad class of systems known to the literature as Discrete-Event/Discrete-State (DEDS) Systems.   Examples of DEDS systems include: air-traffic control systems; automated manufacturing systems; computer networks; integrated command, control, communication and information (C3 I) systems; operations-management of multi-component organizations with event-driven dynamics like shipyards, airports, hospitals, etc. I use the theories of Computation, Coding, Machine Learning, Approximate Algorithms, Online Algorithms and Information Theory to synthesize near-optimal supervisory policies for various problems involving DEDS Systems.
