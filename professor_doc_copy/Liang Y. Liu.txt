BiographyProfessor Liang Y. Liu joined the UIUC CEE faculty in 1992 as a member of the Construction Engineering and Management Program. He has extensive experience in teaching, industry practice, and research in the areas of Construction Engineering and Management. He served as the area coordinator of the Construction Engineering and Management Program for more than 15 years. He also served as the Associate Head and Director of Undergraduate Studies from 2010 to 2016. After carrying dual appointments in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the College of Engineering as the Associate Dean of Facilities and Capital Planning, Professor Liu is currently a CEE Professor Emeritus.
Professor Liu has taught undergraduate and graduate courses in Construction Engineering and Management areas, including Construction Productivity, Cost Estimating, Construction Management Information Systems, and Construction Case Studies. While serving as the Associate Head and Director of Undergraduate Studies, he also taught CEE195 About Civil Engineering-- Introduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering, a required course for all CEE students. Professor Liu's research areas include construction project planning, controls, cost estimating, productivity, safety, information technologies, life-cycle analysis, facility management, and computer simulation. He is member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, American Society of Cost Engineers, Construction Management Association of America, American Society of Computer Simulation, and American Society of Engineering Educators. Professor Liu has been recognized several times for excellence in research, teaching and advising. In 2001, he was named the W. E. O'Neil Faculty Research Scholar. Among his multiple awards and recognitions were the 2003 Teaching Excellence Award of the College of Engineering of the University of Illinois, the 2011 UIUC Campus Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Advising, the 2010/2012 ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) Outstanding Instructor Award of UIUC CEE Department, the 2016 Engineering Council Award for Excellence in Advising, and the 2016 "Excellent Teachers Ranked by Their Students", and the 2016 Civil Engineering Department Award of Excellence in Undergraduate Advising and Mentoring. A passionate teacher and mentor, Professor Liu has been the multi-year recipient of the Engineering Council Award for Excellence in Advising and the "Excellent Teachers Ranked by Their Students" since 1992.
