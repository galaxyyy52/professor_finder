Research StatementOur research focuses on microbial synthetic biology and systems biology - the design, analysis and construction of microbial gene regulatory networks for cellular functionality reprogramming. These are interdisciplinary research areas at the nexus of biology, engineering and physics. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the architecture and dynamics of naturally existing networks and exploring their relationship to cellular function. Examples include bacterial communication networks and their engagement in cellular collective behaviors. We are also interested in developing synthetic gene circuits for novel applications by assembling and editing genes and genomes inside living cells, which is very much like building integrated circuits with transistors and other elements for a computer. Along that line, microbial ecosystem engineering is of particular interest to us due to its potential for biotechnological and therapeutic purposes. To pursue our interest, we adopt L. lactics, E. coli and other microbes as our model organisms and employ an integrated approach that combines experiment with modeling. Techniques from molecular biology, nonlinear dynamics and statistical mechanics are extensively used in our research. Our long-term goal is to uncover basic design principles of microbial gene regulatory networks and to apply these principles to build novel circuits for biotechnological and medical applications.
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesWe are looking for highly motivated undergraduate students to work on synthetic biology and systems biology.
