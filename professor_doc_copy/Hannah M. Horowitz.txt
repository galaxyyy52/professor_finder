BiographyDr. Hannah M. Horowitz joined the CEE department as an Assistant Professor in January 2020. She is also an Affiliate Assistant Professor in the department of Atmospheric Sciences. Her research focuses on the interactions between human activity, atmospheric chemistry, climate, and pollution, through developing and applying global models. Previously, she was an NSF Atmosphere and Geospace Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Washington. She received her Ph.D. in Earth and Planetary Sciences and M.S. in Environmental Science and Engineering from Harvard University. Her awards include a certificate of distinction in teaching, the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and GROW with USAID Research and Innovation Fellowship, and frequent presentation awards at conferences. Dr. Horowitz enjoys engaging in public scientific outreach and diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM activities.

Research StatementDr. Horowitz’s research focuses on the coupling between human activity, climate, biogeochemistry, and pollution, with the goals of informing policy and protecting human and ecosystem health. Questions guiding her research include: How do we get from human activity all the way to environmental and health impacts? How can we improve predictions of impacts to serve society? Examples of Dr. Horowitz’s specific interests are: understanding atmospheric chemistry- and aerosol- climate interactions, predicting future air quality, and assessing impacts of climate change on environmental pollution. In her work, she develops and uses global numerical models at a hierarchy of complexities (simple box models to coupled 3-D Earth system models) informed by analysis of observations and theory.
