BiographyDr. Bragg is the Chicago-based executive director of the Grainger College of Engineering’s Chicago Initiatives where he provides leadership to educational, research and outreach activities in the city.   Prof. Bragg has held numerous leadership positions in the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, including head of the aerospace engineering department, associate dean for research and administrative affairs, executive associate dean for academic affairs, and interim dean.  Prior to returning to Illinois, he served as the Frank & Julie Jungers Dean of Engineering and Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Washington in Seattle.  Dr. Bragg is an international expert on the effect of ice accretion on aircraft aerodynamics and flight safety.  He is a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics and has received the AIAA Aerodynamics Award and Losey Atmospheric Science Award.  In 2017 he received the NASA Public Service Medal and in 2018 was elected to the Washington State Academy of Sciences.
