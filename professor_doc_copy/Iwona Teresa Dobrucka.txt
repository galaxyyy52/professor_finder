BiographyDr. Dobrucka joined the Department of Bioengineering in March 2020. Dr. Dobrucka received her Ph.D. in chemistry from Ohio University, Athens, Ohio, in 2004, and an M.Sc. degree in bioengineering from Technical University of Wroclaw, Poland, and Technical University of Hamburg, Germany. Prior to joining Beckman Institute in 2011 where she directs the Molecular Imaging Laboratory (MIL) in Biomedical Imaging Center (BIC), Dr. Dobrucka did postdoctoral training in cancer biology at Yale University School of Medicine in the Department of Radiation Therapy, New Haven, CT.


Research StatementDr. Dobrucka's fields of professional interests include the development of novel targeted microSPECT/PET-CT imaging strategies to stage cancer disease and assess tumor growth and metabolism in animal models of disease. In addition, Dr. Dobrucka's research is focused on studying interactions between traditional anti-cancer therapeutics and complementary alternative medicines (CAMs) used by cancer patients. Her expertise is in cancer cell biology and the pathophysiology of reactive oxygen species, including molecular imaging of tumor response to therapy and cardiotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs.
