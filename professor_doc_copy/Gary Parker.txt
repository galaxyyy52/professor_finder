Biography


Gary Parker joined the faculty of the Environmental Hydrology and  Hydraulic Engineering group in the summer of 2005. He holds a 75 percent  appointment in the Depart­ment of Civil and Environmental Engineering  and a 25 per­cent appointment in the Department of Geology, where he is  the W.H. Johnson Professor of Geology.
Professor Parker received a B.S. from the Department of Mechanics  and Materials Science of Johns Hopkins University (1971) and a Ph.D.  from the Department of Civil Engineering of the Uni­versity of Minnesota  (1974). Before coming to the University of Illinois, he was an  Institute of Technology Distinguished Professor in the Department of  Civil Engineering at the University of Minne­sota. During the period  1995-1999, he also served as Director of the St. Anthony Falls  Laboratory, a water resources/fluid mechanics laboratory in the same  department.
Prof. Parker was elected a Fellow of the American Geophysi­cal Union  in 2003, and received the G.K. Warren Award in Fluviatile Geomorphology  in 2002. He has received the Schoemaker Award twice and the Ippen Award  from the International Association of Hydraulic Research, and the  Einstein Award, Hilgard Prize and Stevens Award from the American  Society of Civil Engi­neers. In 1991 he also received the University of  Minnesota In­stitute of Technology Outstand­ing Teacher Award. In  addi­tion to numerous journal articles, he has written an e-book, “1D  Sediment Transport Morphodynamics with Applica­tions to Rivers and  Turbidity Currents.” Parker teaches undergraduate and graduate courses  in flu­id mechanics, river engineering, sediment transport. One of Prof.  Parker's major research goals is to use the fundamental techniques of  fluid mechanics and applied mathematics to treat interesting  geomorphological problems. Related special research includes mechanics  of river meandering; oceanic turbidity currents; sorting of mixed grain  sediment by fluvial processes; bank erosion and protection using  permeable dikes and vegetation; and reservoir sedimentation. Development  of a mechanistic understanding of the processes involved with sediment  transport in rivers and the ocean environment, and the morphologies they  create, is of prime importance. River meander migration research has  led to the development of computer models that predict channel shift and  can therefore be used in the design of floodplain structures such as  bridges, intakes, etc. In addition, research on depositional submarine  fans has been found useful to oil companies as a means of helping locate  oil deposits.

Research StatementProfessor Parker’s major research interests are the mechanics of sediment-laden flow in rivers and turbidity currents, and resulting flow-boundary morphodynamic interactions. His current efforts focus on delta evolution, bedrock bedrock-alluvial transitions, bedrock meandering, drainage network formation, advection-dispersion of tracer pebbles, formation of continental shelves, muddy tidal morphodynamics, role of washload in rivers, long-runout turbidity currents and natural dam formation in meteogenic travertine systems.
