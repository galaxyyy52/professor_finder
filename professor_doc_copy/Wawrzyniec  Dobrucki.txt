BiographyWawrzyniec (Wawosz) Lawrence Dobrucki is currently Associate Professor and Associate Head for Graduate Programs in the Department of Bioengineering with affiliations in the Carle Illinois College of Medicine and the Carle R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as well as the Medical University of Gdansk in Poland. In addition, he holds a full-time faculty position at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, where he serves as co-chair for the Integrative Imaging theme and directs the Experimental Molecular Imaging Laboratory (EMIL).His expertise is in preclinical molecular imaging, and his professional interests include developing novel targeted multimodal imaging strategies to noninvasively assess tissue microenvironments and various biological processes in vivo, including therapeutic neovascularization, atherosclerosis, neoplastic progression, and cancer response to experimental therapies.Prof. Dobrucki is also involved in translational bioimaging, utilizing his 17-plus years of experience developing and validating novel SPECT/PET radiotracers and multimodal multifunctional contrast agents. He is a member of the Preclinical Imaging Task Force at the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, charged with developing a preclinical imaging curriculum for medical and bioengineering scientists to address problems with the standardization of small animal imaging protocols. Prof. Dobrucki is a co-founder of two biomedical startup companies and serves as a scientific consultant for Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure Poland.Prof. Dobrucki received his Ph.D. in chemistry from Ohio University, Athens, in 2003 and an M.Sc. degree in bioengineering from Technical University of Wroclaw, Poland, and Technical University Hamburg, Germany. Before joining the Department of Bioengineering as tenure-track faculty in Fall 2013, Prof. Dobrucki was an Associate Research Scientist at Yale University School of Medicine and Senior Research Scientist at Beckman Institute, where he directed the Molecular Imaging Laboratory (MIL) in the Biomedical Imaging Center (BIC).

Research Interests
Development of integrated quantitative imaging approaches to monitor individualized programs for disease prevention
In vivo mapping of biological processes using PET/SPECT/CT molecular imaging with targeted imaging agents
PET, SPECT, X-ray CT, molecular imaging, image analysis, multimodal imaging probes
The combination of different imaging modalities and technologies for mapping biomolecular and biological processes
within single cell or whole organs has an extraordinary potential for revolutionizing the diagnosis and
treatment of pathophysiological disorders, and thus for mitigating the significant social and economic costs associated
with the clinical management of diseases. The focus of Dr. Dobrucki’s research is to develop such integrated
imaging approaches to noninvasively monitor and track physiologic processes including cancer progression, peripheral
and myocardial angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling using functional and anatomical imaging modalities
including SPECT/PET, optical imaging and X-ray CT, respectively. Such imaging strategies will eventually lead to
individualized programs for disease prevention through advanced diagnosis, risk stratification and targeted cell
therapies resulting in more successful and efficient health care.

Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesWe consider undergraduate students from all departments at the University of Illinois. Students will be involved in a research project under the guidance of graduate student. Undergraduates will typically volunteer or work for credit, however exceptional students will have the opportunity to apply for the undergraduate fellowships in the laboratory.
Graduate Research OpportunitiesWe accept graduate student applications through the Department of Bioengineering and the Medical Scientist Training (MST) Program.  We look for students with genuine interests in molecular multimodal imaging (PET-CT, SPECT-CT, PET-optical, etc.), targeted probe development and application of novel imaging strategies to monitor disease progression and efficacy of therapeutic interventions in both cardiology and oncology.
