Professional Highlights
[Research] As of July 2023, I have published 40+ papers at a variety of the strongest computer architecture and systems conferences in my field, including ISCA, MICRO, ASPLOS, OSDI, SOSP, PLDI, FAST, EuroSys, and USENIX ATC, and a dozen patents issued worldwide. Some of my research has been transferred into industry products or received IP license requests.
[Teaching] My research has had an impact on our graduate/undergraduate education. I developed the first graduate-level course on memory and storage systems at UIUC, and the course has been approved as a permanent course ECE522: Emerging Memory/Storage System. I also fully revised the graduate-level course ECE511: Computer Architecture in Fall 2022 by employing the most recent computer architecture topics.
[Awards] My research has received some significant awards, including the ACM SIGMICRO Early Career Award, NSF CAREER Award, NSF CRII Award, Y. T. Lo Faculty Fellow in ECE at UIUC, NVMW Memorable Paper Award Finalist, IEEE Micro Top Picks (twice), IEEE Micro Top Picks Honorable Mention, USENIX Best Paper Award, Google Faculty Research Award, NetApp Faculty Fellowship Award, Microsoft Research Outstanding Project Award, and Best Dissertation Award in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech.
[Grants] As of July 2023, I have received over $3.63M grants ($7.74M in total with my collaborators) from NSF, DARPA, Army Research Office, IIDAI, and industry companies. I am currently advising 9 Ph.D. students, 3 master students, and multiple undergraduate students.
[Media Coverage] My research on non-volatile memory and storage systems has been featured in popular press. For instance, my secure storage research received 30+ media reports that include ACM CACM, ACM TechNews, TechXplore, Science Daily, HIT Infrastructure, Cybersecurity Insiders, etc; our wearable storage research received 50+ media reports that include The Register, CACM, Tech Times, NeoWin, ZDNet, OnMSFT, etc.
[Services] I constantly serve on the PC of architecture and systems conferences such as ISCA, MICRO, HPCA, ATC, FAST, and EuroSys, and as reviewers for journals such as CAL, TACO, TOC, TOS, and TPDS. I was invited to serve as the program co-chair of the 14th Annual Non-Volatile Memory Workshop (NVMW’23) which usually has more than 200 attendees worldwide. I also organized the first Workshop on Hot Topics in System Infrastructure (HotInfra’23).
