BiographyTimothy D. Stark is a Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with an expertise in Geotechnical Engineering.  Dr. Stark has been conducting interdisciplinary research and teaching on the static and seismic stability of natural and manmade slopes, such as dams, levees, floodwalls, and waste containment facilities, railroad geotechnics, geosynthetics and geomembranes, soil liquefaction during earthquakes, and stabilization and behavior of dredged material containment areas.  He has been involved in a number of projects on these topics, which has facilitated the transfer of his research results to practice.  He is currently researching three-dimensional slope stability, inverse analyses of landslides, heating events in waste containment facilities, and jet grouting.   Dr. Stark has received a number of awards for his research, teaching, and service activities including: 2019 George H. Norman Medal, ASCE, 2019; Technical Editors Award, ASTM STP 1605, ASTM, 2018; Spotlight Project at Illinois Transportation and Highway Engineering Conference, Illinois Center for Transportation, 2018; Best 2017 Paper Award, ASCE Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities; Best 2015 Geosynthetics International Journal Paper; Best Research Paper Award, 14th and 13th International Railway Engineering Conference, Edinburgh, Scotland, 2017 and 2015; 2015 James M.
