Research StatementThe foundation of my research is theoretical, computational, and statistical electromagnetics. The classical electromagnetic (EM) theory guided by Maxwell’s Equations has been around for over 150 years. It has an incredible impact on many modern technologies such as antennas and wireless communication, integrated circuits and computer technologies, remote sensing, lasers and optoelectronics, and more. Nowadays, with the exponential growth in computing power, machine intelligence and data revolution, quantum technologies and materials, there are enormous opportunities to continue advancing fundamental EM theories towards next- generation technology developments and applications.My rudimentary research is the pursuit of mathematical and computational models that enable the prediction and discovery of classical and quantum electrodynamic phenomena. These models will allow for the design and optimization of novel electromagnetic systems at unprecedented scales, and contribute through education to the advancement of understanding. In this research statement, I will elaborate my recent and future research in four interrelated areas: (1) classical electromagnetism with scalable algorithms, (2) statistical electromagnetics: theories and practices, (3) quantum electromagnetics: simulating probability in space and time domain, and (4) chaotic reverberation chamber: measurement and control of uncertainties.
