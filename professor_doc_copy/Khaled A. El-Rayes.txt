Research Interests
Research interests focus on analyzing and optimizing the utilization of construction resources and sustainability decisions during the construction of critical civil infrastructure systems, including: optimal resource utilization, optimizing building sustainability decisions, information technologies in construction, optimal construction planning and control, multi-objective optimization, parallel computing, optimal lighting design for night time construction, optimizing recovery and reconstruction efforts after natural disasters, and construction productivity. 

Research StatementResearch Motivation and Focus: The civil infrastructure systems in the United States are rapidly aging and urgently need major rehabilitation efforts to insure the nation’s social and economic prosperity.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) alone estimate a needed annual investment of $115 Billion over the next twenty years to maintain and improve the national highway and airport systems.  To maximize societal benefits from this major public investment, government agencies have recently started to utilize new types of construction contracts and regulations that are designed to accomplish multiple and conflicting project objectives, including improving quality and durability of the renovated systems; minimizing service disruptions during construction; minimizing public expenditures on renovation projects; accelerating the revitalization of aging transportation systems; and maximizing public safety since these systems are often kept operational and open to the public during the reconstruction efforts.  These new contracts and regulations include warranty and nighttime construction contracts for highway projects and the FAA safety guidelines for airport expansion projects.  The increasing utilization of these contracts and regulations present decision-makers in the construction industry with new and serious challenges, including: (1) how to optimize the utilization of limited construction resources for warranty contracts in large-scale highway construction projects in order to maximize construction quality and durability while minimizing its cost and duration; (2) how to optimize the utilization of lighting equipment in nighttime highway construction in order to maximize public safety while minimizing service disruption; and (3) how to optimize the utilization of limited site layout space during airport expansion projects in order to minimize construction-related hazards to aviation safety and security while minimizing site layout costs.  To address these new and vital construction challenges, my research focuses on creating new knowledge on multi-objective optimization of resource utilization to support the construction and renewal of the nation’s critical transportation systems.  The next section highlights my three main accomplishments in this critical research area and the following section outlines my current and future research plans. Summary of Major Research Accomplishments: (1) Parallel Multi-objective Optimization of Resource Utilization in Large-scale Highway Construction: New performance-based contracting methods such as warranty and multi-parameter contracts have been increasingly utilized in recent years in highway construction projects.  These contracting methods create new and serious challenges that require construction planners to search for and identify optimal resource utilization plans that minimize project cost and duration while maximizing its quality.  To address these new challenges, I developed a new multi-objective optimization model that was capable for the first time to transform the traditional 2-dimensional time-cost tradeoff analysis to an expanded 3-dimensional time-cost-quality tradeoff analysis (El-Rayes and Kandil 2005).  This enables construction planners to generate, visualize and analyze a set of optimal resource utilization plans that represent unique and optimal tradeoffs among construction time, cost and quality.  I also formulated scalable parallel computing methodologies to enable the optimization of resource utilization in large-scale highway construction projects (Kandil and El-Rayes 2005).  I conducted more than 180 computaional experiments to evaluate the performance of these frameworks using various combinations of project sizes, numbers of parallel processors and parallel computing setups (Kandil and El-Rayes 2006a).  The results of these experiments demonstrate that parallel computing frameworks can be used to efficiently and effectively optimize resource utilization in large-scale constructoin projects that were previously considered impractical to optimize due to their extensive computational time requirements.  The experiments also proved that the parallel computing frameworks can be implemented using a limited and practical number of parallel processors that can be readily available in construction management offices.  My research in this area was supported by a National Science Fondation Career Award in 2003 and its contribution was widely recognized by several awards and publications, including the ASCE Thomas Fitch Roland Proze in 2007, and a featured Science Success Story by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications quartely publication (Access 2005).  (2) Optimizing the Utilization of Lighting Equipment in Nighttime Highway Construction: To reduce construction-related daytime traffic disruptions, an increasing number of highway construction projects is being performed during nighttime hours.  Despite the increased utilization of this type of construction, it is still confronted by serious challenges including inadequate lighting conditions in work zones that neagtively affects construction quality and public safety; and the lack of detailed lighting standards for this type of construction.  To address these challenges, I developed a new multi-objective decision support system to optimize the utilization of lighting equipment in nighttime highway construction projects (El-Rayes and Hyari 2005).  The developed system enables construction planners to identify optimal lighting arrangements that maximize average illuminance and lighting uniformity to insure construction quality while minimizing lighting glare to minimize its hazardous effects on the travelling public.  I also formulated an innovative and scientific framework to establish lighting standards and requirements for nighttime work zones using an interdisciplinary methodology that integrates concepts from vision science and construction technology (Hyari and El-Rayes 2006).  The results of this research work were adopted by the Illinois Department of Transportation in its new lighting specifications for nighttime highway construction and were cited as a research success in a series entitled “Research Pays Off” that were published by the Federal Highway Administraion in the Transportaion News publication in January 2009.(3) Optimizing the Utilization of Limited Site Layout Space in Airport Expansion Projects: A large number of major airport expansion projects are either on-going or being planned to meet the significant increase in air traffic demand. One of the main and unique challenges in managing construction sites in this type of project is caused by the close proximity between construction activities and critical airport operations, which increases the level of hazards to both aviation safety and airport security. To address this critical challenge, I developed new multi-objective optimization models for planning airport construction site layouts that are capable of minimizing construction-related hazards while minimizing construction site layout costs (Khalafallah and El-Rayes 2006).  These models provide new and uniqe capabilities to support the optimization of conflicting objectives including maximizing compliance with all relevant Federal Aviation Adiminstration safety guidelines; preventing the spread of construction debris that can damage aircraft engines and landing gears; controlling the risk of security breaches originating from the nearby construction site; and minimizing construction site layout costs. This enables construction planners to generate and visualize optimal site layout plans and identify an optimal location for each temporary facility on site and an optimal use of debris containment measure and/or security devices. My research in this area was supported by a National Science Fondation Award in 2006.   My research accomplishments in this area have been recognized nationally and internationally, receiving numerous research awards including the best journal paper award from the ASCE Journal of Construction Engineering and Management in 2009, the ASCE Thomas Fitch Rowland Prize in 2007, and the National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2003.  I also received fourten research grants to support my research at UIUC including nine as the lead PI and five as Co-PI from the National Science Foundation, Illinois Center for Transportation, Qatar National Research Fund, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, and Mid-America Earthquake Center.  The outcome of this research was published in fourty four papers in leading journals.  My research work has also resulted in graduating five Ph.D. students, who are currently employed as Assistant Professors in the Departments of Civil Engineering at Purdue University, the University of Washington, Columbia University, the University of Central Florida and the Hashemite University of Jordan.    Current and Future Research Plans: My other ongoing research focuses also on multi-objective optimization of resource utilization to support the construction and renewal of critical civil infrastructure systems, including (1) optimizing the reconstruction of damaged bridges and roads after major disasters to maximize the overall recovery of the transportation network while minimizing the reconstruction costs; (2) optimizing housing efforts in the aftermath of natural disasters to minimize social and economic disruptions while minimizing overall public housing expenditures; (3) optimizing green design and construction sustainability decisions for new and existing buildings and other infrastructure systems; (4) evaluating and minimizing glare-related safety hazards in and around nighttime highway construction zones; and (5) optimizing work zone layouts to maximize the safety of highway construction.  My long-term research plan is to remain at the forefront of multi-objective optimization and decision making in construction engineering and management.  The goal of my research is to support the construction industry and government in their efforts to maximize societal benefits from the planned public investments in the nation’s critical civil infrastructure systems.  These research plans integrate well with two main initiatives that have been identified in the UIUC Strategic Plan: Illinois Informatics Initiative and the Illinois Sustainable Energy and the Environment Initiative.
