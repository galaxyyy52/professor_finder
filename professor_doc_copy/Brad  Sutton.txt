Research StatementMy research is focused on developing novel methods to image structure and physiological function with magnetic resonance imaging, including changes with disease and aging.  Application areas include functional neuroimaging and dynamic imaging of muscle function in speech.
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesDuring various disease states and even during healthy aging, the human brain undergoes dramatic changes in structural and functional organization, along with changes in metabolic support structures.  Magnetic resonance imaging offers many windows into this changing physiology.  Analysis of such changes requires applications of linear algebra and statistics upon very large data sets.  Currently, there are positions for undergraduates to learn and apply structural analysis methodologies to disease populations such as multiple sclerosis.
