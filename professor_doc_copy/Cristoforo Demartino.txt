Overview




BiographyCristoforo Demartino is an Assistant Professor in structural engineering at ZJU-UIUC. Cristoforo Demartino focuses his research on structures with a particular interest in bridges, wind and earthquake engineering, reliability, and development and use of green materials for construction. The main idea of Cristoforo Demartino is real engineering advancement of Engineering will involve a multi-disciplinary approach and cooperation across disciplines. The key idea is that breaking boundaries between traditional engineering disciplines can create cross-disciplinary teams and activities, and encourages multidisciplinary knowledge convergence and cross-cooperation. He has a wide research interest in structural engineering, with emphasis on investigating dynamic behaviors of structures under natural and man-made loading, such as earthquake, wind, impact, etc. The research was carried out using both numerical and experimental approaches.
