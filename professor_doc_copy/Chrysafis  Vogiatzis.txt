Research StatementMy current research interests lie in network optimization and combinatorial optimization, along with their vast applications in modern socio-technical and biological systems. One of the main axes of my research is focusing on the study of centrality metrics in biological, social, and infrastructure networks, in order to identify groups and persons of interest. More specifically, my research interests are in operations research (broadly defined) and include:

Network analysis and optimization
Combinatorial optimization
Decomposition techniques
Evacuation and disaster management
