BiographyJ. Riley Edwards, Ph.D., P.E., is a Senior Lecturer and Research Scientist in the Rail Transportation and Engineering Center (RailTEC) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Illinois).  He obtained his Bachelors degree in Civil Engineering from Vanderbilt University, and his MS and PhD in Civil Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  After obtaining his Bachelors degree, he worked for the Canadian National Railway as a Construction Inspector on their Intermodal Gateway Memphis project.  Dr. Edwards also worked for Hanson Professional Services, Inc. as a Construction Engineer on BNSF Railway’s Memphis Intermodal Expansion project in Tennessee.  Since 2007, Dr. Edwards has held various positions in RailTEC at Illinois where he oversees rail infrastructure research and advises graduate and undergraduate students concentrating in rail engineering.  His research interests are railway infrastructure track system and component design and performance and failure modes associated with infrastructure components.
