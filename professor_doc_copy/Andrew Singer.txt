Education
Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, M.I.T., in 1996

BiographyAndrew C. Singer received the S.B., S.M., and Ph.D. degrees, all in electrical engineering and computer science, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1990, 1992, and 1996, respectively. Since 1998, he has been on the faculty of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he is currently holds the Fox Family Endowed Professorship and the rank of Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and serves as Associate Dean for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the College of Engineering.  He also holds the rank of Professor in the Departments of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering and in the Department of Business Administration in the College of Business.  During the academic year 1996, he was a Postdoctoral Research Affiliate in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT.  From 1996 to 1998, he was a Research Scientist at Sanders, A Lockheed Martin Company in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he designed algorithms, architectures and systems for a variety of DOD applications.  His research spans algorithms and architectures for statistical signal processing and communication systems, as well as information theory and machine learning.  He was a Hughes Aircraft Masters Fellow, and was the recipient of the Harold L. Hazen Memorial Award for excellence in teaching in 1991.  In 2000, he received the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, in 2001 he received the Xerox Award for Outstanding Faculty Award, and in 2002 was named a Willett Faculty Scholar.  He has received numerous awards and honors, including Best Paper Awards from the IEEE Solid State Circuits Society in 2006 for his paper in the Journal of Solid State Circuits, and in 2008 from the IEEE Signal Processing Society for his paper in the Signal Processing Magazine.  Dr. Singer has served as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing and is a member of the MIT Educational Council, and of Eta Kappa Nu and Tau Beta Pi.  He is a Fellow of the IEEE and was selected as a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Signal Processing Society in 2014. From 2005-2017, Dr. Singer served as the Director of the Technology Entrepreneur Center (TEC) in the College of Engineering creating and overseeing courses and activities attended by over 5,000 students annually.  In 2017 he was named Interim Director of the Siebel Center for Design and in 2018 was appointed as Associate Dean for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the College of Engineering. In 2000, he co-founded Intersymbol Communications, Inc., a venture-funded fabless semiconductor IC company, based in Champaign Illinois, which brought an MLSE-based electronic dispersion compensation chip-set to the optical communications market.  In 2007, Intersymbol Communications, Inc., was acquired by Finisar Corporation. In 2015, he co-founded OceanComm, developer of real-time video capable, Mb/s underwater wireless communication systems. Dr. Singer serves as an expert witness for legal matters in the signal and audio processing and communications industries.
