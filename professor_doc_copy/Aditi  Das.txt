Research Interests
Dietary consumption of ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids changes the overall physiology in animals and humans. One of the pathways to change the overall physiology is the conversion of ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids into epoxide derivatives via the enzymes in the epoxygenase (EPOX) pathway. Most of these epoxides are anti-inflammatory in nature. 
The prime research direction in our laboratory is to elucidate the biochemical mechanism of the enzymes in the EPOX pathway and to study the biological role of the novel anti-inflammatory ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acid epoxides. 
Another important research direction in the laboratory is the study of endocannabinoid metabolism by cytochrome P450 leading to the discovery of novel endocannabinoid epoxides that are anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory.
