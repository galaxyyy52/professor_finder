Other Professional Activities
Co-Founder and Scientific Advisor, IntelliWheels, Inc., Champaign, IL, May 2010 – January 2018 

Research StatementI direct the Human Dynamics and Controls Laboratory (HDCL) in the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering. Our research group uses methods from design, control theory, mechatronics, pneumatics and soft robotics, musculoskeletal biomechanics, and movement analysis. The HDCL focuses on investigating and improving movement control and function through two main areas: assistive device development and locomotion biomechanics. The HDCL’s interest in assistive device development stems from a desire to improve function and the quality of life of persons with disability. 
Research Interests
Locomotion biomechanics

Wearable devices and autonomous apparel for mitigating anxiety
Robotic medical education task trainers
Rolling mobility devices: wheelchairs (including ball-based wheelchairs)
Design and control of mechatronic devices in healthcare


Research Areas
Dynamics  & Controls
