BiographyDr. Mironenko is an assistant professor at the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. He develops theory-driven quantum mechanical methods to lower the cost of structure and chemical reactivity predictions of molecules and materials. Current chemistries of interest include oxidation catalyzed by metal carbide surfaces and liquid-filled porous zeolite materials, carbonylation on single-atom catalysts, and alkane/alkene electroseparations. Dr. Mironenko has been recognized with a number of honors, including ACS Petroleum Research Fund Doctoral Investigator Award (2021), Allan P. Colburn Outstanding Dissertation Prize in Mathematical and Engineering Sciences (2019), and Kadanoff-Rice Postdoctoral Fellowship (2018-2020).  He joined the department in August 2020.
