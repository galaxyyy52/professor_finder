BiographyAnn Sychterz(SICK-tesh) obtained her PhD in 2018 from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) addressing the novel use of control algorithms, statistical diagnostic tools, and real-time feedback on a full-scale tensegrity structure to enable smooth deployability, damage detection, adaptation, and learning. During her masters of applied science obtained in 2014 at the University of Waterloo, she built full-scale aluminum pedestrian bridges for vibration characterization and control. She completed a postdoctoral position at the University of Michigan on actuator optimization of adaptive origami structures. With her team at SMARTI lab at the University of Illinois, they harness geometrically nonlinear systems, such as tensegrity structures and origami, for adaptive civil infrastructure. She is a faculty fellow of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and a faculty affiliate of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology in the Autonomous Materials Systems group. She is an active member of the Association for Shell and Spatial Structures (IASS) in working group 15: Structural Morphology.Ann has had industry experience in design firms such as civil and mechanical engineering at Walterfedy in Kitchener, Canada and structural engineering at MMM Group in Toronto, Canada. These large-scale interdisciplinary projects -- such as Conestoga College and St. Joseph's Healthcare in Hamilton -- were focused on sustainable design and LEED certification. During her undergraduate degree, she was a captain of the UW student team for the Great Northern Concrete Toboggan Race and also served as a mentor for the concrete canoe and ASCE steel bridge student teams.

Research Statement A manifestation of sustainability in infrastructure is the reduction of embodied energy and energy required in the manufacturing process. Adaptive structures show promise to address challenges for structures currently being overdesigned and unmodifiable our ever-changing environment. Emerging technologies for civil engineering structures combine sensing with real-time active feedback control which includes form-finding methods, structural dynamics, statistical diagnostic tools, sensor placement optimization, robotics, and multi-scale experimental testing. This work combines structural engineering with mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and architecture for experimental and analytical research to develop active control adaptive systems for civil infrastructure.
