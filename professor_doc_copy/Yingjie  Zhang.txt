Research StatementThe Zhang group study complex interfaces and molecular systems, with the goal of: 1) understanding the fundamental atomic and molecular scale processes at solid-liquid interfaces, such as dynamic solvation, electrochemical energy conversion, and catalysis; deciphering the structure, distribution, and function of various small molecules in electrochemical and biological systems; and 3) bringing solutions to the society, in areas of renewable energy and healthcare.Our research is highly interdisciplinary, spanning over areas of materials/physical chemistry, condensed matter physics, chemical engineering, and mechanical/electrical engineering. We are always looking for motivated graduate students, postdocs, and undergrads to join us.
