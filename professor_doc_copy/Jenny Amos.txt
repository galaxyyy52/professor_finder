Research StatementMy main research objective is to study applications of research-based pedagogy in the classroom and across a curriculum as well as design of assessment strategies for measuring student learning. Most of my educational research is at the program level, focusing on changes in faculty development and training needed to support new pedagogy as well as tracking student performance and development across the curriculum. I also have a passion for bringing professional skills (communication, ethics, historical perspectives, intercultural competency, and life-long learning) into the forefront of engineering education. My work spans K-12 outreach, undergraduate, graduate, and professional education settings. 
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesMy lab is always looking for outstanding candidates with an interest in education and skills in computing, statistics, modeling, and creating visual representations of data. Lab members will work in a multidisciplinary team to solve problems in engineering and medical education. 
Graduate Research OpportunitiesMy lab is always looking for outstanding candidates with an interest in education and skills in computing, statistics, modeling, and creating visual representations of data. Lab members will work in a multidisciplinary team to solve problems in engineering and medical education.
