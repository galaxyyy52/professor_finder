BiographyAndrey Mironov received both the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the National Research University of Electronic Technology (Moscow, Russia) in 2010 and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) in 2016. Currently, Dr. Mironov is a Research Assistant Professor in the Laboratory for Optical Physics and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He has conducted research in the areas of laser physics, nano-optics and materials, optical physics, and photochemical materials fabrication for more than 10 years. Dr. Mironov has demonstrated several new lasers and lamps, including rubidium (Rb)-rare gas lasers having a quantum efficiency above 100%, and narrow-band 194 nm lamps that have made possible a new generation of compact optically-driven atomic clocks. Recently, he co-invented a photolithographic technique employing flat vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) lamps to inexpensively fabricate nanostructures and optical components in polymers. Dr. Mironov is a co-inventor of 11 issued or pending patents, and a co-author of 15 scientific publications and more than 30 conference talks in the fields of low temperature plasma devices, nano- and microfabrication of optics and semiconductors, and laser spectroscopy.
