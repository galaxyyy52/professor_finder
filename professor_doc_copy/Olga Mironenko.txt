Teaching StatementThere is no doubt that teachers possess tremendous power to make difference in the lives of their students. An effective, inspiring teacher can promote interest in the subject, while a less effective one can completely discourage students from pursuing a discipline. A good teacher is very passionate about the subject and should be able to explain complex concepts to students in a clear and concise way, so that even freshmen can understand. He or she should also demonstrate to students the applicability of gained knowledge to address real world challenges, as well as to benefit to student’s future career goals. Finally, a good teacher should create trusted atmosphere to make students comfortable asking any questions.
