BiographySusan Leggett is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering. She is an Associate Member in the Cancer Center at Illinois and an Affiliate in the Carl R. Woese Institute of Genomic Biology. Susan received her Ph.D. from Brown University in May 2018 and completed postdoctoral training at Princeton University in December 2022. She joined the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering in January 2023. She has been awarded several honors in her field of expertise and has received national recognition; She is a 2012 Goldwater Scholar and was named a 2021 Rising Star in Engineering and Health by Columbia and Johns Hopkins University. 


Research Statement Dr. Leggett’s research integrates live-cell imaging, bioengineering, and machine learning to elucidate dynamic single and collective cell behaviors that drive cancer progression. Her research has established tools to reverse-engineer tumors and comprehensively profile the morphology, migration, and mechanics of cancer cells with high spatiotemporal resolution. This integrative approach enables the visualization and analysis of complex cell-cell and cell-microenvironmental interactions that take place in heterogeneous and evolving tumors, providing insight into individual patient disease to advance personalized medicine. 
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesWe are eager to have undergraduate students join the lab. Interested students should reach out to Dr. Leggett directly.
Graduate Research OpportunitiesWe are actively recruiting graduate students and direct interested individuals to apply to UIUC's Bioengineering Ph.D. program
