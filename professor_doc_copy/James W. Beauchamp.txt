Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesEach semester I work with a group of undergraduate students who wish to carry out projects in music signal processing. Examples of recent successful projects have been "automatic saxophone squeak elimination", "hum removal", "pitch detection of solo musical phrases", "time-scale modification of non-vibrato tones while retaining timbral texture", "time stretching of vibrato sounds while preserving vibrato rate", and "chord recognition using spectral maximum likelihood matching". Some projects have resulted in students giving presentations at  UIUC College of Engineering Undergraduate Research Resource Fairs, regional symposiums, and international professional meetings.
