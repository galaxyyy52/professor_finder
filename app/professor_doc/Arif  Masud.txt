Research Interests
The Computational Mechanics Lab of Professor Arif Masud is focused on the development of New Classes of Stabilized and Variational Multiscale Methods for a wide range of problems in fluid and solid/structural mechanics, biofluid dynamics, nonlinear material modeling in additive manufacturing, and numerical methods for physics-constrained machine learning. These methods are fundamental to the development advanced simulation techniques to address societal challenges of sustainability of built infrastructure, energy, and environment.

Research Statement Scientific problems of contemporary interest involve large datasets spanning a broad spectrum of spatial, material, and temporal scales from multiple interacting physical fields. Modeling and analysis of this class of problems invariably involves heavy computing that necessitates efficient use of the emerging hardware architectures for computationally economic solutions. Numerical methods that can address these challenges need to be grounded in mathematically rigorous and robust variational formulations that are (i) scale aware, (ii) applicable to the broad spectrum of multi physics phenomena, (iii) facilitate the embedding of Data-Driven and emerging Machine Learning technologies without upsetting the consistency of the underlying physics-based methods, and (iv) exploit the hierarchical compute architectures of the advanced computing platforms. 
 Professor Arif Masud's research is focused on the development of New Classes of Stabilized and Variational Multiscale Methods from a mathematical viewpoint for advanced scientific problems in fluid mechanics, solid/structural mechanics, biofluid dynamics, nonlinear material modeling in additive manufacturing, and physics-constrained machine learning. These methods are targeted at simulation of complex systems involving nonlinear coupled fields with evolving weak and strong discontinuities that are ubiquitous in Engineering and Sciences, and therefore have broad applications. Areas of interest are: 
 Multiscale Methods for Fluid and Solid/structural Mechanics 
Turbulence, Non-Newtonian Fluids, Microbubble flows, Chemically reacting flows 
Biomechanics, Nonlinear Material Modeling, Computational Micro/Nanomechanics 
Physics-Constrained Data-Driven Modeling and Additive Manufacturing 
The fundamental ingredient in these works is a unified mathematical framework that transcends the traditional fluid and structural mechanics sub-disciplines and yields variational formulations with enhanced stability properties. This unique feature results in a systematic framework for developing high fidelity solution techniques for coupled field problems. Because of the firm mathematical basis, the resulting frameworks are equipped with a-posteriori error estimation module for symmetric and non-symmetric systems. The technical papers present novel constructs for a variety of topics that include (i) residual-based closure models for turbulence, (ii) interfacial methods for coupling multiple PDEs across non-matching discretizations in fluid-structure interaction, and in Stokes-Darcy type flows, (iii) enforcing of internal constraints in non-Newtonian blood flow models, (iv) upscaling of quasi-continuum mechano-electronic properties of nanomaterials, (v) enforcing interfacial physics in multiphase bubbly flows, (vi) coupled models for thermally-driven nanofluids, (vii) mixture theory based viscoelastic constitutive models for tissue modeling and growth, and (viii) finite-strain thermoelasticity with embedded discontinuities for multi-constituent materials in additive manufacturing.
