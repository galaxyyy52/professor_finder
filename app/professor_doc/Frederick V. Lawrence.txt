Biography
Frederick  V. Lawrence, Jr. holds a B.S. (Swarthmore College 1960), S.M.  (Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1962), C.E. (M.I.T. 1965) all in  civil engineering, and a Sc.D. (M.I.T. 1968) in materials science. He  has been on the faculty of the department of Civil and Environmental  Engineering at the University of Illinois since 1968. He is also a  member of the faculty in the department of Metallurgy and Mining  Engineering. From 1976 to 1989, Dr. Lawrence was the Director of the  UIUC Materials Engineering Research Laboratory. Since August 1996, Dr.  Lawrence has been an Associate Head of the Department of Civil  Engineering at the University of Illinois at UC. In September 2000, Dr.  Lawrence was appointed the Director of the Newmark Structural  Engineering Laboratory.
Dr. Lawrence has taught courses in welding and mechanical properties of materials, and construction materials.
Dr. Lawrence is a member of the American Welding  Society (AWS), the American Society for Testing and Materials, and the  American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). He was the Co-editor of the  ASCE Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering from 1988 to 1996.
Dr. Lawrence has received the following awards or  honors: the American Welding Society Adams Memorial Membership Award  (1976), The A. E. Davis Silver Medal (American Welding Society) (1977),  The Deutsche Forschung Gemeinschaft Fellowship (1981), and the  Structural Engineers Association of Illinois Certificate of Honor  (1981).


Research StatementDr. Lawrence's research activities have been concentrated on the topic of mechanical properties of welds, and he has written numerous technical articles on the influence of weld discontinuities on the their tensile and fatigue properties. He has published over one hundred reports and technical papers. His most recent research has been on the thermite welding of railroad rail.
