Teaching StatementIn Computer Music, I would like students to get an appreciation for computer music and its technology.  Since musicians and engineers live in quite different worlds, I would like engineering students to learn what it means to do "serious" interdisciplinary work with sound designers and musicians.In undergraduate teaching, I feel it is important to nurture ECE student pride in their ability to design and build working devices.  It is important for students to have enough time to implement their own ideas; it is good experience for students to learn how to select chips, how to design PCBs, how to design and debug software and dsp algorithms, how to work with the machine shop, etc.  Both guided learning in structured courses as well as independent project experience are important for our undergraduates.
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesI encourage undergraduates that would like to do research towards designing and implementing devices to look into ECE395.  The primary goal of ECE395 is to build the device; you decide on all hardware components, PCB layout, software programming, motor control or any mechanical aspects you may have, etc.  If you develop novel algorithms or techniques you may optionally present your results at the Undergraduate Research Symposium, and optionally show your work at Engineering Open House.

Research Honors
Lippold Haken was listed as one of five leading individuals to have remodeled the musical human-machine interface since 1900.  The list also includes LÃ©on Theremin, Pierre Schaeffer, Robert Moog, and Don Buchla. (J. Technology and Culture, Vol 56, No 1, Jan 2015, p. 176)
The prestigious electronic music research institute, IRCAM Centre Pompidou (Paris), sponsored and hosted "ContinuuCon 2018" April 26 through April 28, 2018.  ContinuuCon is a conference wholly devoted to the Continuum Fingerboard, an electronic music instrument invented by Lippold Haken.
The Bob Moog Foundation, MakeNoise, and ExperimentalSynth.com sponsored the inaugural ContinuuCon.  "ContinuuCon 2016" was in Asheville NC June 9 through June 11, and attracted performers, sound designers, composers, and electronic music enthusiasts from North America, Europe, and India.  Since 2016, the annual conference has enjoyed excellent press coverage and has helped disseminate novel approaches and techniques from the worldwide Continuum Fingerboard community.
