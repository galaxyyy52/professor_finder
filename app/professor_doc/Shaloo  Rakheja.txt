BiographyI am an expert in physics-based modeling of nanoelectronic and magnetic devices for energy-efficient computing and communication. The models I create are predictive in nature, provide guidance to experiments, reduce costs of test-structures, improve the turnaround and success rate of laboratory tests by preventing trial and error, and enable correct interpretation of experimental data. I have been actively disseminating the simulation programs I develop via the open-source platform, nanoHUB, since 2013. The purpose of my computational outreach is to strengthen the innovation loop between materials scientists, device engineers, and circuit designers and eventually enable new functionalities in the next-generation sensing, memory, computing, and communication technologies.

Other Undergraduate Advising Activities
Organized annual hands-on summer workshop called creative circuit design C2D at NYU. The workshop was conducted every summer from 2016 to 2018, until I relocated to UIUC. This was the first of its kind workshop organized within the ECE department at NYU, aimed at inspiring high school rising juniors and seniors to build circuits and understand how electrical and computer engineering has shaped our daily lives and to further motivate them for pursuing an engineering degree in college. Each year approximately 20 high school students were selected out of a total of 100-120 applicants to participate in the one-week workshop help on the engineering campus of NYU in Brooklyn. The workshop was geared toward building circuits including light sensors, logic gates, potato batteries, AM radio circuit, and programming Raspberry pi. The basic concept underlying this workshop is to increase awareness about electrical engineering and to lead young students on a path of self- discovery. I have also steered my undergraduate and Ph.D. students to supervise portions of the workshop, providing relatable models to high school students for how an engineering career can take off. To sustain and grow the workshop in future, my plan is to submit an NSF grant proposal that supports K-12 outreach activities particularly to provide access to circuit building blocks to underrepresented minorities in high school to increase their awareness and motivate them to pursue college in STEM fields.

Research StatementMy research interests are in understanding, predicting, and modeling physical phenomena in materials that drive their functional behavior and enable multifaceted applications in the domains of low-power logic and memory, sensing, brain-inspired computing, and wireless communication. From 2015 to mid-2019, I was an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University (NYU), where I established my independent research laboratory called “Quantum Nanoelectronics Laboratory”. The focus of my lab was on digital and high-frequency electronics, including terahertz (THz) devices and spin-based computing. Since joining UIUC in Fa. 2019, I have continued to grow in the area of physical modeling of electrical, thermal, and magnetic excitations in nanoscale devices. I have successfully used my models to enable a co-design framework wherein the different layers of the design hierarchy – materials, devices, and circuits – are simultaneously optimized for maximum system-level benefits.In the area of digital and high-frequency electronics, I have developed analytic models to describe the static and dynamic behavior of III-nitride high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), photoconductive switches using wide bandgap semiconductors, ultra- low-power steep sub-threshold and Schottky-barrier transistors, graphene plasmonic interconnects, and nano-antennas that can operate at the THz frequency. I also have a profound interest in studying dynamics of magnetic nanostructures, the impact of noise on magnetization dynamics, and applications of magnetic materials to non-volatile, low-power on-chip memory systems, probabilistic and non-Boolean computing, and dynamically reconfigurable circuits that are inherently secure against invasive and non-invasive hardware attacks. My regular interaction with experimentalists in industry and academia has taught me the strength of collaborative research and interfacing of theoretical research with experimental demonstration. I have continued to advance collaborative, multi-disciplinary research in my work since joining UIUC. Currently, I am the Director of the “Center for Aggressive Scaling by Advanced Processes for Electronics and Photonics (ASAP)”, an NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC), which is currently funded as a Planning Center by the NSF. Along with the ASAP Leadership Team, comprising faculty from the three independent research units on campus, I am in the process of recruiting industry members and together will map out a strategy for enabling highly energy-efficient computing systems. I envision the ASAP Center to be a highly multi-disciplinary center where scientists and researchers intimately understand the computing challenges that cut across domains and conceive and develop solutions with orders of magnitude improvement in system performance.
Graduate Research OpportunitiesIf you are interested in conducting your doctoral research in my group, please email me with a copy of your CV, research statement, and a short slide deck with an overview of your prior research experience and future goals. Please note that I will not  be responding to inquiries that are outside of my current research interests. 
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesI invite motivated undergraduate students from Electrical Engineering and Physics to reach out to me for research opportunities in the area of modeling and simulation of nanoelectronic devices, as well as the co-design and co-optimization of materials, devices, and circuits for energy-efficient computing.
