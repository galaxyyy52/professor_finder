BiographyMarcelo H. Garcia holds the M.T. Geoffrey Yeh Endowed Chair of Civil Engineering and serves as Director of the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory. He joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 1990, becoming a full professor in 2000. Prior to joining UIUC, he was a Research Fellow for two years at St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory, University of Minnesota, where he also completed his graduate studies  (MS'85, PhD'89)in Civil Engineering. In 2001, he was invested as Chester and Helen Siess Endowed Professor of Civil Engineering and as an Honorary Professor at his alma mater, Universidad Nacional del Litoral (UNL).

Research Interests
River mechanics, sedimentation engineering, environmental hydrodynamics, turbidity currents, debris and mud flows, reservoir sedimentation, flood hazard engineering.

Research StatementDr. Garcia research interests have evolved from his early work on sediment transport by turbidity currents in lakes and oceans . His pioneering observations of turbidity currents in the laboratory provided insight about the mechanics of submarine sedimentation, including the first direct observations of internal hydraulic jumps and the deposits created by flows laden with poorly-sorted sediments. Measurements of sediment entrainment made it possible to assess the erosive power of turbidity currents and their ability to transport sediment deep into the oceans, providing a missing link in the source-to-sink saga.  Interest in the mechanics of sediment transport resulted on research in sediment entrainment from riverbeds and coastal areas, flow and transport in vegetated channels, meandering streams and rivers  and the dynamics of mudflows and debris flows. Large scale laboratory experiments with model continental margins made it possible to learn about the role played by turbidity currents on strata formation with support from the Office of Naval Research (ONR).  A Large Oscillating Water-Sediment Tunnel has been used to research oscillatory boundary-layer flows and ripple morphodynamics under field-like conditions. A custom-made Kinoshita meandering flume has been used to investigate the morphologic impact of meander skewness and secondary flows in high-amplitude bends.   RVRMeander has been used to provide guidelines in stream restoration projects involving re-meandering of channelized streams. Current research efforts involved sedimentation hazards due to dam and embankment failures, dynamics of mudflows, development of rapid response models for oil spill containment after pipeline rupture, and risk of flooding in alluvial fans. Garcia's group has also conducted extensive research on scour and burial of pipelines and objects in oscillatory boundary layer flows, in oil spill dynamics and rapid response following the Kalamazoo River oil spill as well as the transport and fate of invasive species eggs in rivers.  Over a decade his group has developed hydrologic and hydraulic models to predict urban flooding and the performance of the "Deep Tunnel" during extreme rainfall events in Chicago, Illinois. Implementation of a 3D hydrodynamic model of the Chicago River led to the discovery of salt-laden density currents activity along the bottom during the winter months. A complete hydrodynamic and water quality model, including sediment diagenesis to capture oxygen demand at the sediment water interface, has been implemented by Garcia's group to assess the water quality conditions in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). His applied research has also focused on improving the performance of stormwater management and wastewater treatment infrastructure with the help of computational techniques to protect Chicago's waterways and Lake Michigan, the main source of fresh water for Northeastern Illinois. Most important has been the  work to increase safety at low-head dams by modifying spillways and providing canoe passages to prevent drowning accidents in Illinois.   Garcia's research has been funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. At the state level, Dr. Garcia has received support from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRDGC), the Illinois Water Resources Center, the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant Program and the Sanitary District of Decatur, Illinois. Most experimental research is conducted in the state-of-the-art experimental facilities of CEE's Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory, Grainger College of Engineering, which has recently undergone renovations as part of the new Civil and Environmental Engineering  Building and Smart Bridge Construction.
