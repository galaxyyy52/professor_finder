BiographyI am currently a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I obtained my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the same university under the supervision of Prof. Ravi Iyer. During my graduate program, I was fortunate to be mentored by Dr. Gregory Worrell at the Mayo Clinic through the Mayo-Clinic-Illinois Partnership. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka. I have also spent a summer at Google and collaborated with Google Accelerated Science and Medical Brain teams.

Research StatementI am broadly interested in health data analytics, machine learning, and computational neuroscience. Specifically, I am interested in developing domain-guided machine learning models for health data analytics, with specific applications in neurological diseases. My research is experimental in nature, with firm foundations in signal processing, machine learning, probabilistic graphical models, statistics, algorithms, and fundamental neuroscience.
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesI am available to mentor motivated undergraduates interested in machine learning and healthcare.
