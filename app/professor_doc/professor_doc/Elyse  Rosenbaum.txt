Education
Ph.D.,  Electrical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley,    Dec. 1992

BiographyElyse Rosenbaum is the Melvin and Anne Louise Hassebrock Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of California, Berkeley. She is the director of the NSF-supported Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML), a joint project of the University of Illinois, Georgia Tech and North Carolina State University. Her current research interests include machine-learning aided behavioral modeling of microelectronic components and systems, compact models, circuit reliability simulation, component and system-level ESD reliability, and ESD-robust high-speed I/O circuit design. 
Dr. Rosenbaum has authored or co-authored about 200 technical papers; she has been an editor for IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability and IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices. She was the recipient of a Best Student Paper Award from the IEDM, Outstanding and Best Paper Awards from the EOS/ESD Symposium, a Technical Excellence Award from the SRC, an NSF CAREER award, an IBM Faculty Award, and the ESD Associationâ€™s Industry Pioneer Recognition Award. She is a Fellow of the IEEE.
