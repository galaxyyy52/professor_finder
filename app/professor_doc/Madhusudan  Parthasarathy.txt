Professional Highlights
 Defined a formal language class called  visibly pushdown languages  (also called  nested word  languages. 
This has had a tremendous impact in academia (see Wikipedia page entries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_word ).
This has not just been widely cited, but has defined a new model that people have extensively studied
 (see http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&as_oq=%22nested+words%22+%22visibly+pushdown%22 for a Google Scholar search for "nested words" OR "visibly pushdown" that lists more than 940 entries).



The class of visibly pushdown languages is an insertion into the Chomsky hierarchy, falling between regular languages and deterministic context-free languages, but which possesses most closure properties that regular languages have while yet remaining tractable. In particular, the inclusion problem is decidable and this has led to applications ranging from XML processing to program verification to programming languages. 

Research Interests
  Reasoning with heaps in software verification (Natural proofs, Strand, separation logic); 

    Software Verification; 
    Reliable and secure software engineering; 
    Security; 
    Program Synthesis; 
    Logic and Automata Theory.

Other Scholarly Activities
Visited Microsoft Research, India during sabbatical (2012-2013).
Helped initiate a very large MOOC platform for India, called MASSIVELY EMPOWERED CLASSROOMS.
This massive online classroom setting is a unique blended classroom meant for undergraduate students in India.
Undergraduate colleges in India have a huge quality problem. The blended classroom allows tens of thousands of students in India
to access quality lectures and class material that is synchronized with their study.
Huge grassroots movement to engage teachers, involve them in the platform, incentivize colleges to participate, and certificate
program to incentivize students to take the course to get jobs.
Organized and partially lectured the first course on the platform as well.
The program has been a huge success with a large number of courses and tens of thousands of undergraduate students each semester.
