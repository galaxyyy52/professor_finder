Teaching StatementWe want to provide a hands-on systems-level understanding of autonomous systems for Illinois undergrads. ECE484 is a unique course designed to educate the next generation leaders about the implications of technical design choices. 
Research StatementThe goal our research is to develop algorithms and software tools for safe autonomous systems. We use techniques from theoretical computer science and control theory.
Graduate Research OpportunitiesWe are looking for graduate students with background in CS theory (formal methods, logic, automata theory, algorithms) and/or control theory. Solid programming skills & other mathematical background (e.g. stochastic processes) would be a plus. As an graduate researcher you will develop new verification and synthesis algorithms, build tools, and perform experiments in using these tools on real systems. 
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesWe are looking for juniors/seniors with solid programming skills (E.g., C/C++, Java, Matlab) and who intend to go to grad school in one of the related research areas. Preference will be given to those who can commit to working at least 6-8 hours a week for a couple of semesters. You will work closely with one of the graduate students towards developing software tools or applying them to verify a systems. This typically leads to an undergraduate thesis or publishable work. Take a look at some of the research projects.
