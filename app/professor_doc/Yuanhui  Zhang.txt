Research Interests
Indoor air quality, effect of indoor air quality on occupants, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning control.  His team has developed and continued research on aerodynamic filter-less air cleaning; and three-dimensional, near-real-time volumetric particle tracking velocimetry (VPTV) for room air flow measurement and modeling. His book, Indoor Air Quality Engineering, has been used as textbook in several universities.
Professor Zhang has pioneered the research in Environment-Enhancing Energy (E2-Energy), in which he combines waste treatment, water cleaning, carbon dioxide sequestration and biofuel conversion into one process. He has successfully converted biowaste including animal and human waste, food processing waste and algae into crude oil using thermochemical conversion (TCC) much similar to mother-nature's petroleum-formation, but in a few minutes rather than geological years. Professor Zhang's research is to enhance the quality of living by focusing on the immediate environment of living things, people, animal and plants.
