Research StatementDr. Xing Wang's research group utilizes nucleic acids and protein engineering to create and customize designer DNA nanostructure-based “plug-and-play” platforms for the applications in engineering, biology, and medicine.  He also has plenty of experience in RNA-mediated genome programming and cellular engineering.  Dr. Wang is the inventor of the "DNA Star" platform.  He is a winner of Mikashi Award in 2021.  The research of his Nucleic Acids Programming Lab (NAPL) is currently focused on the development of (1) ultrasensitive and inexpensive biosensors for rapid disease diagnostics in both point-of-care and laboratory high throughput settings, (2) effective therapeutic candidates for the treatment/prevention of infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy, (3) new bioreagents for high to super resolution imaging.  Dr. Wang is the co-director of the Center for Pathogen Diagnostics (CPD) in the ZJU-UIUC DREMES.  His research group is currently supported by the NIH/NIBIB, NIH/NIAID, NIH/NIDCR, NIH/NIAAA, and NSF.
