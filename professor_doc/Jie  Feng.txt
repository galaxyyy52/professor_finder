Research Interests
We study micro-scale transport phenomena of structurally complex fluids and interfaces, to derive new insights in physico-chemical mechanisms and continuum-scale mechanics of multi-phase soft matter systems, as well as for their applications to solving some most challenging problems in environment remediation and human health, such as pollutant and disease control, oil recovery, drug delivery and nanomedicines. We actively tackle problems and explore new research directions by using microscopy, microfluidics, high-speed imaging and image analysis, materials processing and characterization. We also complement our experiments with theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, using ideas from fluid dynamics, polymer physics, colloidal science and biophysics. Our work is thus highly multi-disciplinary, combining expertise from engineering, physics, chemistry, materials science and biology. Our ultimate goal is to bridge fundamental research with meaningful and positive societal impacts. Currently, we focus on three key areas in our work: (1) Bubble dynamics with a structurally compound interface (2) Vesicle responses in non-equilibrium environment (3) Polymer self-assembly for drug delivery and disease diagnostic.
