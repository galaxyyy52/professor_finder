BiographyXiming Cai has been on the CEE at Illinois faculty since 2002, where he teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in water resources engineering, surface water hydrology and application of geographic information systems, and river basin management. He holds a B.S. in Water Resources Engineering (1990) and an M.S. in Hydrology and Water Resources (1994) from Tsinghua University, China, and a Ph.D. in Environmental and Water Resources Engineering (1999) from the University of Texas at Austin. Cai’s current research areas include coupled human-natural system analysis with an emphasis on human interferences in hydrological processes, water-energy-food system modeling, and sustainable water resources management particularly in developing countries. Cai has authored or co-authored more than 210 peer-reviewed journal papers, three books and several monographs. He has been a consultant to several organizations, including the World Bank, the United Nations and other international agencies. Previously, Cai served as associate director of Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment (iSEE), a campus-wide institute at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Cai currently serves as Chair of Task Force bureau, International Water Resources Association (IWRA) on downscaling Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to country/region, basin, and local scale for sustainable water resources management around the world.He has received several awards for his work, including the National Science Foundation CAREER award and best paper awards from Water Resources Research, Water International, and the Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management. Cai is an elected 2019 American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fellow, cited for “forging a new science of hydrologic change accounting the human dimension and using it to advance water resources management.” He was recently selected to receive the 2023 Julian Hinds Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers’ Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI). He was cited for “leadership advancing a holistic vision and a comprehensive approach that integrates scientific advances, hydrologic science and cutting-edge technologies to water resources planning and management with social objectives, economic concerns and community involvement.”
