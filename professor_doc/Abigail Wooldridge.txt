Research StatementProfessor Wooldridge's research addresses the design of complex sociotechnical systems, primarily in healthcare settings, using mixed methods approaches to improve outcomes. In healthcare, that means patient outcomes (e.g., patient safety, quality of care) as well as clinician outcomes (e.g., workload, burnout). She has conducted research focused on primary care, care coordination of patients with chronic conditions (hospital to community care transitions) and trauma care. Her dissertation, conducted in the context of a larger project developing health information technology to support teamwork and care transitions, took a macroergonomic approach to studying care transitions of trauma patients. She then examined on the handoff communication associated with those handoffs as instances of team cognition. Current projects include continuing to study care transitions; she plans to conduct observation studies of inpatient care transitions between hospital units as well as return to the community care setting by studying hospital discharge care transitions. Part of this work will explore the concept of the “patient journey,” i.e., spatio-temporal distribution of patients’ interactions with multiple care settings (e.g., hospitals, clinics, home, long-term care, etc.) over time. She plans to develop interventions, such as redesigned processes, new technologies, etc., to improve care transitions; this will involve participatory design processes and usability evaluations in her lab and/or simulated settings such as JUMP Simulation. A third area of research includes developing ways to measure team cognition, particular in care transitions. Key components of her research approach include engaging frontline workers (patients and their family as well as various healthcare professionals) and utilizing mixed methods, i.e., both qualitative and quantitative, research designs.Check out the Human Factors in Sociotechnical Systems Laboratory, directed by Dr. Wooldridge, website at https://hfss.ise.illinois.edu/contact-us/
Graduate Research OpportunitiesHuman factors is a diverse field, and much of the work we do requires knowledge from multiple disciplines. Therefore, Professor Wooldridge is interested in having students from various majors including industrial engineering, computer science, psychology, health sciences, community health, and related fields.
A good starting point for all interested graduate students is to send an email to Professor Wooldridge that describes:

Your previous research and/or work experience
Why you specifically want to work with Professor Wooldridge
How your research interests align with the Macroergonomics and Complex Systems Lab.

Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesGetting involved in research is a great way to apply knowledge learned in class and enhance your education - it is also a great way to explore the idea of graduate school. Students can get involved in projects in various stages, through a variety of ways. Interested students should email Professor Wooldridge directly.
