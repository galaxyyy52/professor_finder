Research StatementThe era of big data will lead to systems necessitating the transport of large amounts of information. Today's high-speed I/O signaling links are faced with difficult challenges: pins and interconnects available for off-chip signaling remain almost constant, while the throughput needed is increasing and the required aggregate bandwidths are moving into the Tb/s range (with target bit error rates as low as 10-21 for memory links). High-speed chip-to-chip communication has historically been considered less critical than the on-chip signaling performance; however, due to today's huge demands for data throughput, off-chip interconnect bandwidth is increasingly becoming the system bottleneck, and creative solutions are needed to meet the requirements, now measured even in terabytes per second  for graphic processing cores. Due to manufacturing and technology limitations, the physical dimension scaling of the passive package and interconnect systems is unable to keep up with the rapid miniaturization benefits enjoyed by active devices (such as silicon chips in CMOS technology nodes) which is dictated by Moore's law. Therefore, the resources (pins and interconnects) available for off-chip signaling remain almost constant, while the throughput needed is increasing. This trend is expected to persist in the future. At the same time, in order to keep up with the data throughput needed over limited resources, high edge rates are being used for signaling. This causes various signal integrity impairments, which in turn limit the system performance and force the data rates to be well below the Shannon limit of the channel capacity. Coupled with the limited channel resources are the conflicting requirements of low power and extremely reliable signaling . All of these limitations combined call for creative solutions in order to keep up with the performance demands of next-generation systems. In our research group we investigate how these changes will affect the different aspects of high-speed link design. We develop modeling and simulation strategies as well as techniques for mitigating noise while reducing power.
