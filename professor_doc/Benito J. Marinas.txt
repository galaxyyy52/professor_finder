BiographyBenito J. Mariñas holds a B.S. degree (Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain 1982) in civil engineering, and M.S. (University of California at Berkeley 1985), Ph.D. (University of California at Berkeley 1989) degrees in sanitary and environmental engineering. He has been on the faculty of the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois since 1995 and has been an Arthur and Virginia Nauman Faculty Scholar since 1998. Prior to coming to the University of Illinois, Dr. Mariñas was a faculty member (1989-1995) at the School of Civil Engineering of Purdue University, West Lafayette, Ind.

Dr. Mariñas has taught graduate and undergraduate courses covering various fundamental, laboratory experimentation and design aspects of environmental engineering and science with particular emphasis in physico-chemical treatment processes for water quality control.

He is a member of the American Chemical Society, American Society of Civil Engineers, American Water Works Association, Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors, International Water Association, and Water Environment Federation. He has served these societies through participation in several committees. 

Dr. Mariñas has been the recipient of several prestigious awards including the Harold Munson Outstanding Teacher Award (1992), and Ross Judson Buck '07 Outstanding Counselor Award (1992) from the School of Civil Engineering at Purdue University, and the Arthur and Virginia Nauman Faculty Scholar Award (1998-present) from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
