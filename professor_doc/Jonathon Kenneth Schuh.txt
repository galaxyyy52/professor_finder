BiographyJonathon K. Schuh obtained in BS with Highest Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2013. He obtained his MS in Mechanical Engineering in 2015 and his Ph.D. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics in 2018, both from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After graduating with his Ph.D., Jonathon worked as a postdoctoral research associate with Professor Pete Sauer, the Grainger Chair Emeritus Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois, on control of magnetic actuators. He also taught sections of ECE 330: Power Circuits and Electromechanics. In January of 2020, Jonathon joined the ECE Department as a Teaching Assistant Professor. He also obtained a Master of Business Administration, also from the University of Illinois, in 2021.
