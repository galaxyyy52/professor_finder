BiographyProfessor Praveen Kumar holds a B.Tech. (Indian Institute of Technology,  Bombay, India 1987), M.S. (Iowa State University 1989), and Ph.D.  (University of Minnesota 1993), all in civil engineering.  Kumar joined as a faculty at Univ. of Illinois in 1995 where he has been since. Prior to joining University of  Illinois, he was a research scientist (January 1993 to July 1995) at the  Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and Hydrologic Sciences  Branch, NASA- Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, USA.Dr.  His research deals with Hydrocomplexity, the quantitative understanding and prediction of emergent patterns of form and function that arise from complex non-linear multi-scale interactions between soil, water, climate, vegetation and human systems; and how this understanding can be used for innovative solutions to water and sustainability challenges. He has made extensive, deep and signature contributions pertaining to Critical Zone science for intensively managed landscapes, biosphere-hydrosphere interactions, multi-scale variability of hydrologic processes, hydro-geomorphology, hydroinformatics, and information theory in geosciences.   His research has been funded by federal agencies such as NSF, NASA, and NOAA.

Research StatementDr. Kumar’s research deals with Hydrocomplexity, the quantitative understanding and prediction of emergent patterns of form and function that arise from complex non-linear multi-scale interactions between soil, water, climate, vegetation and human systems; and how this understanding can be used for innovative solutions to water and sustainability challenges. His research has been funded by federal agencies such as NSF, NASA, and NOAA. He presently serves as the Director of the Critical Zone Observatory for Intensively Managed Landscapes. He is also the lead on NSF supported EarthCube project on Geo-Semantics, and a co-lead on NSF supported SEAD and Brown Dog projects for the development of cyber-infrastructure for structured and unstructured long-tail data and models.
