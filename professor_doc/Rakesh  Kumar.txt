BiographyRakesh Kumar is a Professor and John Bardeen Faculty Scholar in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign with research and teaching interests in computer architecture and system-level design automation. His research has been recognized through an ISCA Influential Paper Award, a MICRO Test-of-Time Award, an ICCAD Ten Year Retrospective Most Influential Paper Award, an ASPDAC 10 Year Retrospective Most Influential Paper (MIP) Award, three selections to ISCA-50 Retrospective, several best paper awards and best paper award nominations (IEEE MICRO Top Picks, ISCA, ASPLOS, HPCA, CASES, SELSE, IEEE CAL), IIT Kharagpur Young Alumni Achiever Award, ARO Young Investigator Award, and UCSD CSE Best Dissertation Award. His teaching and advising have been recognized through Stanley H Pierce Faculty Award and Ronald W Pratt Faculty Outstanding Teaching Award. He often writes about issues at the intersection of technology, policy, and society  and has commented on semiconductor issues for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, BBC, and Fortune, among others. His book Reluctant Technophiles (Sage Select: Dec 2021) was one of "GQ's Best Indian Non-fiction Books of 2021". Rakesh has a BS from IIT Kharagpur and a PhD from University of California at San Diego.

Research StatementOur work spans all layers of the computing stack - circuits, architectures, compilers, systems, and applications. A typical member of my research  group is creative, hardworking, motivated, and ambitious. He/she has strong programming skills, with a background in circuits, CAD, or computer architecture. He/she is open to learning new skills and considers hard problems as particularly interesting. Students who do not fit the above profile are, in general, not good fits. 
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesI am always looking for motivated and exceptional undergraduate students to join my group. Email rakeshk@illinois.edu if you want to do research in computer architecture. See our research/publications pages (http://passat.crhc.uiuc.edu) for a sampling of our research. Please attach your CV as well.
