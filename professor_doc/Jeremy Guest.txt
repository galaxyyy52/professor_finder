BiographyDr. Jeremy Guest (pronouns: he/him/his) is an Associate Professor and the David C. Crawford Faculty Scholar in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The core goal of Professor Guest’s group is to advance circular bioeconomies to achieve equitable, healthy, and prosperous communities while simultaneously enhancing the ecosystems that support them. His group makes progress toward this goal on two fronts: (i) increasing access to and the sustainability of sanitation in both developing and technologically advanced communities, which they pursue by developing technologies and service delivery models that manage sanitation media (i.e., human bodily excreta) as a renewable resource; and (ii) expediting the research, development, and deployment (RD&D) of technologies that advance the sustainability of agriculture and the conversion of plants to bioproducts, biofuels, and nutritious foods. Central to their work is Quantitative Sustainable Design (QSD), a structured methodology to inform engineering, investment, and policy decision-making.Professor Guest currently serves as the Associate Director for Research for the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment at UIUC, as the Sustainable Design Lead for the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (a $262.5M center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, DOE), and as the Illinois Thrust Lead for Sustainability for the IBM-Illinois Discovery Accelerator Institute (a $200M venture launched in 2021). He is the recipient of a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award, the 2016 recipient of the Paul L. Busch Award for innovation in applied water quality research from the Water Research Foundation, and the 2021 James J. Morgan Environmental Science & Technology Early Career Award for creativity and leadership in his field. His research has been sponsored by a number of agencies including the NSF, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. DOE, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Professor Guest’s formal training includes a B.S. and M.S. in civil engineering from Bucknell University and Virginia Tech, respectively, and a Ph.D. in environmental engineering from the University of Michigan.
