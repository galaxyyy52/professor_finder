Research StatementDr. Imoukhuede's research applies systems biology to study clinically relevant questions in cancer and cardiovascular disease.  The laboratory engineers fluorescent nanosensors that quantitatively characterize the vascular microenvironment and develops computational models that integrate those molecular and cellular data to inform on the processes occurring in vascular pathologies.  These systems biology methods, experimental and computational, are used to predict the efficacy of angiogenic therapeutics and to identify novel drug targets and treatment schemes.
Graduate Research OpportunitiesWe accept graduate student applications through the Department of Bioengineering and the Medical Scientist Training Program.  We look for students with experience in molecular/cellular biology, biophysics/biophotonics, computer science/engineering, and/or mathematics.
