BiographyProfessor Shuming Nie is the Grainger Distinguished Chair in Engineering, Professor of Bioengineering, Chemistry, Materials Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Founding Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Nanjing University (China).  His academic research is primarily in the areas of nanomedicine; image-guided cancer surgery; cell-based immunotherapy; wearable optoelectronic devices and digital health.  His major academic achievements include the discovery of colloidal metal nanoparticles that are able to amplify the efficiencies of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) by 14-15 orders of magnitude, his pioneering work on water-soluble semiconductor quantum dots for biomedical applications, and his breakthrough work in developing multifunctional smart nanoparticles for integrated biomedical imaging and therapy, including image-guided cancer surgery. Professor Nie has published over 300 papers, patents, and book chapters, have delivered nearly 500 invited lectures around the world, and have trained over 30 doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows who are now making an impact at top academic institutions and biotech companies. His scholarly work has been cited more than 90,000 times according to Google Scholar. Professor Nie received his BS degree from Nankai University (China) in 1983, earned his MS and PhD degrees from Northwestern University (Evanston, Illinois, 1984-1990), and did postdoctoral research at Georgia Institute of Technology and Stanford University (1990-1994).For more information, see Dr. Nie's Google Scholar Profile at https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8_C-MpAAAAAJ&hl=en.
