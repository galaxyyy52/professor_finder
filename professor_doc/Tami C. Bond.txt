Tami Bond's research group

BiographyProfessor Tami Bond joined the faculty in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in 2003. Since 2007, she also has been an Affiliate Professor in Atmospheric Sciences.

Bond teaches undergraduate courses in statistics and energy and environment, and graduate courses in air quality monitoring. She holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Washington, a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, and an interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Atmospheric Sciences, Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering from the University of Washington.

Her awards include a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowship (2014), a University Scholar at the University of Illinois (2012-2015), appointment as an AGU Fellow (2015), and a National Science Foundation CAREER grant (2004-2008). She currently serves on a National Academy of Sciences panel on the Future of Atmospheric Chemistry, and as Convenor for an ISO working group on Clean Cookstoves and Clean Cooking Solutions.

Research Interests
Household energy provision in rural and peri-urban areas
Human and infrastructure constraints on emission mitigation
Physical, optical and chemical properties of particles
Emission measurement and characterization, especially remote sources
Air pollutant emission inventories of the past, present and future

Research StatementBond’s research addresses the interface between energy use, engineering decisions, atmospheric composition and global climate. Her research includes development of past, present and future global air pollutant emission inventories, including how policy, engineering, and individual choices affect future emission trajectories. Her group has made field measurements of particle emission rates and properties under remote and challenging conditions around the world, and they also examine the behavior of particle properties under laboratory conditions. The Bond group promotes a “decision-to-impact” framework that traces a causal chain from technology choice to emission rates to atmospheric behavior to net climate and health impact.
