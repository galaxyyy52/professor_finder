Education
Ph.D. in Materials Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1990

BiographyKent D. Choquette received B.S. degrees in Engineering Physics and Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado-Boulder and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  From 1990 to 1992 he held a postdoctoral appointment at AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ. He then joined Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, and from 1993 to 2000 was a Principal Member of Technical Staff.  While at Sandia in 1994 he invented and demonstrated the first monolithic selectively oxidized vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) which today is referred to as the oxide-confined VCSEL, which toay is manufactured around the world and over a billion have been deployed in data communication and sensing applications. He became a Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois in 2000.  His Photonic Device Research Group is centered around the design, fabrication, characterization, and applications of vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), photonic crystal light sources, nanofabrication technologies, and hybrid integration techniques for photonic devices. Dr. Choquette has authored over 300 technical publications and three book chapters, and has presented numerous invited talks and tutorials.  He is an Associate Editor of the Journal of Lightwave Technology, and served in the past as Associate Editor of IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, and IEEE Photonic Technology Letters, and as a Guest Editor of IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics.  From 2000 to 2002, he was an IEEE/Lasers and Electro-Optics Society (LEOS) Distinguished Lecturer.  He was awarded the 2008 IEEE/Photonics Society Engineering Achievement Award, the 2012 Nick Holonyak, Jr. Award from the Optical Society of America, the 2013 Distinguished Service Award from the IEEE Photonics Society, and the 2016 Technology Achievement Award from SPIE. He has served as the IEEE Photonics Society Vice President of Conferences, Vice President of Technical Affairs, President Elect, and in 2016-2017 he will serve as the President. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, a Fellow of the Optical Society of America, a Fellow of SPIE, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Teaching StatementThe among the reasons that I joined the University of Illinois, after spending 10 years at Bell Laboratories and Sandia National Laboratories, is the opportunity to teach the next generation of scientists and engineers, and the personal challenge and freedom to learn new areas of science and technology.  I teach undergraduate courses covering the physics and fabrication of solid state devices.  In particular, I teach a new introduction course on photonics and its applications in digital information distribution (ECE304), as well as a hands-on photonics lab where students can work with and learn about gas, semiconductor, and fiber lasers (ECE495).  I also teach three graduate courses, an introduction to compound semiconductors and semiconductor lasers (ECE532); a graduate course which I created that covers quantum optoelectronics and microcavity lasers, where students learn applied quantum mechanics and quantum optics (ECE572); and a graduate course which I created that covers the interaction of light with matter on the nanoscale (ECE574).
Research StatementThe Photonic device research group is involved in the study of semiconductor photonic and optoelectronic device physics, fabrication technologies, and systems with a strong emphasis on vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs). Photonic devices are key components for the infrastructure of the Information Age. Active devices, such as VCSELs, are the foundation for short and soon medium length optical fiber based interconnect applications. Currently there are research efforts to develop new VCSEL devices, such as composite resonator VCSELs and vertical cavity photonic integrated circuits, as well as to establish new VCSEL applications, such as 2-dimensional source and receiver arrays for high aggregate rate interconnects.  Group research into new compound semiconductor processing technologies, such as selective oxidation and heterogeneous integration techniques is also pursued. Finally, the next generation of photonic devices, such as photonic crystal membrane lasers, waveguides and nanocavities, which will enable the next generation of quantum optic communication networks, as well as opto-fluidic microsystems for lab-on-the-chip sensing and health care are under under study.
