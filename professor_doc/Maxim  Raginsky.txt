Education
Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, Northwestern University, 2002

BiographyMaxim Raginsky received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree in 2002 from Northwestern University, all in Electrical Engineering. He has held research positions with Northwestern, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (where he was a Beckman Foundation Fellow from 2004 to 2007), and Duke University. In 2012, he has returned to the UIUC, where he is currently a Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Coordinated Science Laboratory. He also holds a courtesy appointment with the Department of Computer Science.
Research StatementProf. Raginsky's interests cover probability and stochastic processes, deterministic and stochastic control, machine learning, optimization, and information theory. Much of his recent research is motivated by fundamental questions in modeling, learning, and simulation of nonlinear dynamical systems, with applications to advanced electronics, autonomy, and artificial intelligence.
