BiographySeid Koric received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Sarajevo (1993). He earned M.S. in aerospace engineering (1999) and Ph.D. in mechanical engineering (2006) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dr. Koric is currently the associate technical director at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and a research associate professor in the Mechanical Science and Engineering Department at the University of Illinois. He provides technical and strategic leadership for the NCSA’s Research Consulting directorate, whose staff works on solutions for grand challenges in industry and academia.
Earlier in his career, Dr. Koric developed, implemented, and tested several ground-breaking numerical methods for solving highly nonlinear multiphysics and multiphase problems in materials processing. They have been used worldwide to optimize continuous casting and other steel-making processes and minimize their defects and CO2 footprint. Later, Dr. Koric led research projects on the world’s first sustained open-science petascale supercomputing system of Blue Waters that demonstrated the scalability of engineering industrial applications on the peta and even potentially exascale computing level. Since 2019, Dr. Koric has led novel interdisciplinary research at the University of Illinois, demonstrating how artificial intelligence (AI) with innovative machine and deep learning methods could assist and drastically accelerate (up to 10,000x speedups) classical numerical methods and even replace them or solve some previously considered unsolvable problems in engineering and science.
Dr. Koric also worked in multiphysics, advanced manufacturing processes, sparse linear solvers, biomechanics, finite element methods, GPUs, and industrial HPC computing. His research has been highly influential, earning him an array of prestigious HPC and engineering awards – most notably the two top supercomputing achievement awards in 2014 and 2017. He has published or contributed to over 90 research papers and articles on a diverse range of topics.
