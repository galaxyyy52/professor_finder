Biography


Albert J. Valocchi received his B.S. in  Environmental Systems Engineering from Cornell University in 1975 and  did his graduate studies at Stanford University in the Department of  Civil Engineering, receiving his M.S. in  1976 and Ph.D. in 1981.  He has been on the faculty of the Department  of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois  since 1981, and currently holds the rank of Professor.  From 2004 to  2012 he was Associate Head and Director of Graduate  Studies.
Dr. Valocchi teaches undergraduate and  graduate courses in water resources engineering, groundwater hydrology  and contaminant transport, groundwater modeling, and numerical  methods.
Dr. Valocchi’s research focuses upon  mathematical modeling of pollutant fate and transport in porous media,  with applications to groundwater contamination and remediation.  He  specializes in the development  and application of models that couple physical, geochemical, and  microbiological processes over a wide range of spatial and temporal  scales.   Other recent research interests include geological  sequestration of carbon dioxide, parameter estimation, and uncertainty  quantification. He has over 110 refereed journal papers, 10 book  chapters, and is co-author of the book In Situ Bioremediation.
Dr.  Valocchi is a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the  American Geophysical Union, the National Ground Water Association, the  Association of Environmental  Engineering and Science Professors, the Society for Industrial and  Applied Mathematics, the American Society for Engineering Education, and  Sigma Xi.  From 2003 to 2011 he was Editor-in-Chief for the Journal of Contaminant Hydrology and is currently Associate Editor for  Advances in Water Resources.  He has also served as a member of the National Research Council Committee on Environmental Remediation at Naval Facilities.
 
Dr.  Valocchi has received several awards in recognition of his research and  teaching accomplishments.  He was a Shell Faculty Career  Fellow from 1984 to 1987, and he has been awarded fellowships to  lecture and conduct research from NATO and the Danish Research Academy.   In 2002 he received the Collins Award for Innovative Teaching from the  University of Illinois College of Engineering.   In 2003 he was recognized as an Associate in the Center for Advanced  Study at the University of Illinois.  In 2009 he became a Fellow of the  American Geophysical Union, an honor bestowed on no more than 0.1% of  society members.   In 2011, he was named an Abel  Bliss Professor in the College of Engineering at the University of  Illinois.  In 2013 he was received the Stanley H. Pierce Award from the  College of Engineering in recognition of his work toward enhancing the  graduate student experience. In 2015 he received  the Campus Award for Excellence in Graduate and Professional Teaching.
